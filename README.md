# Curitiba_156
In this repository I analyzed the Curitiba Citizen complains about the city. 156 is a municipal call center made to analyze and realize people's needs.

We can see that in some neighborhoods the complains are almost the same about the pickup frequency of the garbage, while in others the most frequent complains is about traffic.

Some more interisting insights are in the branch "apresentacao".
